# ICFP 2017 Postmortem.

### Intro

For the third straight year, I participated in the ICFP annual programming contest with the same team.  And for the third straight year, I found myself frustrated, with the feeling that I could not get my ideas into the final product.  This post is intended to serve as a reminder, mostly to myself, of the lessons I should be learning from this experience.

I was first invited to participate with this team in 2015.  From the outset, it was clear that there was a strong skills mismatch between myself and the rest of this team.  The primary languages I know are Python, C, Fortran, and a tiny bit of Java.  My teammates were most fluent with Ruby, and that was the language they chose then, and also in 2016, with a bit of elm thrown in for a pretty problem viewer within the browser.  In both of those years, my teammates jumped right in to building the infrastructure needed to participate in Ruby, which left me pretty much only able to suggest ideas.  Most of which, I felt, were never even tried, because everyone was busy working on their own ideas and testing them.  So I would set out to try to build something..anything to test my own ideas, which meant re-inventing the wheels my teammates had already invented.  And that was frustrating.  But at the same time, I was still a contributer to the team, because at least at the outset, I could offer my ideas for solving the problem and they would be considered.  Even if by then end I felt that my ability to contribute to the final solution were mostly over, despite the ideas I had for solving the problem.

I honestly expected more of the same this year.  I thought about teaching myself the basics of Ruby before the contest, and on some level I wish I would have.  But it would have made no difference, because ultimately the team decided to use elixir instead.  A language that I am completely unfamiliar with.  Still, this year left me even more frustrated than years past.  Because instead of just feeling like dead weight by the end of the contest, I actually felt like a hinderance to our team.

At 11 days out, the organizer of our team mentioned the possibility of using elixir, but right up until the start of the contest, no language had been chosen as the one we would use.  Unfortunately, I had to work the morning that the problem specification dropped, so I missed out on the crucial first 6 hours or so in which most of the major decisions about how to proceed had been made.  When I arrived, all of my teammates were happily banging out elixir code to move the solution forward while I sat down to read the (problem specification.)[https://icfpcontest2017.github.io/static/task.pdf]

Pretty quickly I realized that there was a python library that I was familiar with that was capable of handling a lot of the heavy lifting.  And that's where my frustration really began.  In past problems, regardless of the language chosen, the framework for solving the problem itself had to be created nearly from scratch.  And while my teammates were busy building that framework, I realized that I already had it, on my machine, ready to go.  

I really hate re-inventing wheels.  I've done enough of it in the past that I get frustrated when it has to be done again.  I suggested finding a graph library for elixir.  Apparently they looked and couldn't find one available.

So I opened up a Jupyter notebook, loaded one of the problem maps, and began playing.  With NetworkX, I could already do all of the things that they were talking about implementing.  Find the shortest path from A to B?  Bam, one line, and fast too.  Find the choke points along the route? Two lines.  Find the minimum number of edges that would need to be removed to disconnect two points?  Easy.

And that's where I became a hinderance.  I showed these things to my teammates.  I recruited one member of the team to help me get to something that could call a python script from elixir to get a strategy, and took him away from other things he could have been doing.  Not to mention the fact that in working out the communication between his code and mine, we managed to break everything else, for a short time.

I kept wanting to work on the math problem.  I like math problems.  Maybe too much.  I kept trying to come up with strategies that I could easily work out in python.  Numerous ones.  It wasn't hard.  But connecting them into the framework that everyone else was working on was hard.  And repeatedly trying to do so only wasted time.  Not just mine either.

### Takeaways

I could have instead tried to find other ways to make myself useful.  For instance, I would have liked to have had a game simulator.  Something more easily accessible for testing strategies against one another than the online server that the organizers had set up.  I could have built a python based game server that everyone else could have used to quickly and continuously used to test and iterate their strategies.  That would have been a very useful contribution.  Super useful in fact.


Maybe I'll go make one anyway in preparation for next years contest.

I still question whether or not I can fit in with this team. The language barrier is larger than I thought.  Especially in the context of a 72 hour contest.  I like all of my teammates just fine, but the frustration of thinking I know how to approach a problem, only for that way to be incompatible with the method my teammates use is not getting any smaller.  Granted, I do not actually know a whole lot of python developers personally.  Perhaps I need to be more active in the OKC python group, and get to know them more.  It would be at the least, a nice experiment to see if putting together a python-only team makes for a better experience.  It may not.  I may find that I just don't do well in teams.  I fear that may be the case.  I've been a solo developer for so long now, that I'm sure I've developed some habits that make working as part of a team more challenging for me.  Perhaps I need to find more ways to do just that.

Anyway, that's all for now.  I may update this later.  I may not.  But this is more for me than you anyway.
